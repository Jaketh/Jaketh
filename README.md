### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jake. You can call me Jake. I've been known to write a lot JavaScript. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently architecting Fundraising solutions w/ Fundraise Up and loving it!
- ðŸŒ± I completed my AWS Architect cert in 2021.
- I tinker a lot in my free time. Mostly with cloud stuff but my son and I have gotten into lego robotics lately. Highly recommend for anyone with kids age 8-13
